# Week 1


The tasks for the first week include:

* Create histogram image descriptors for both the museum images and the query sets
* Implement similarity measures to compare the images
* Implement a retrieval system to get the K top results
* Evaluate the results using the MAP@k metric
* Background removal of images from QS2
* Evaluate the masks and the retrieval system for QS2

The available histogram features include:

* "gray_historam"
* "rgb_histogram_1d"
* "rgb_histogram_3d"
* "hsv_histogram_1d"
* "hsv_histogram_3d"
* "lab_histogram_1d"
* "lab_histogram_3d"
* "ycrcb_histogram_1d"
* "ycrcb_histogram_3d"

The metric parameter indicates the similarity measure that is used for comparing the images. The following metrics are available:

* "cosine"
* "manhattan"
* "euclidean"
* "intersect"
* "kl_div"
* "bhattacharyya"
* "hellinger"
* "chisqr"
* "correl"

# Evaluate query sets
Use fastsearch.py to get the map@K measure. Usage:
```python fastsearch.py ["--museum_path MUSEUM_PATH] [--query_path QUERY_PATH] [--descriptor DESCRIPTOR] [--metric METRIC] [--bins BINS] [--map_k MAP_K]```

Call structure:

Compulsory parameters:

1. `DESCRIPTOR` Use one of the available histograms features discussed earlier.
2. `METRIC` Use one of the available similarity measures from the list above.
3. `BINS` Number of bins to use for the histograms
4. `MAP_K` Number of results (K) to use for MAP@K

Optional parameters: 
1. `MUSEUM_PATH` Path to reference museum dataset
2. `QUERY_PATH` Path to query museum dataset


# Background removal
Masks are generated by using the script `masks.py`, located in the `root/week1` folder. To check its usage, run:

```$ python masks.py -h```

Call structure: 

```python masks.py [--query QUERY] [--retriever RETRIEVER] [--output OUTPUT]```

Where all parameters are compulsory:
1. `QUERY` is the path to the query dataset
2.  `RETRIEVER` is the background removal strategy to use and must be one of the following options:

        {color_mono, color_multi_rgb, color_multi_hsv, color_multi_sv, color_multi_lab, color_multi_ycbcr, color_multi_xyz, edges}

3. `OUTPUT` refers to the folder where the generated masks will be stored (created if does not exist).
